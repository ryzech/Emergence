[RiverWM](https://codeberg.org/river/river) for the versioning system they use.

[Yazap](https://github.com/prajwalch/yazap) for the amazing CLI library!

[OgloTheNerd](https://gitlab.com/Oglo12) for making [Rebos](https://gitlab.com/Oglo12/rebos), this is certainly inspired by it but for my own use case, and in zig instead! <3
